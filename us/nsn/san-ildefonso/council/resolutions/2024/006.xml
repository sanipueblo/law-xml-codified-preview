      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>

    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Council has been fully briefed and has reviewed the proposed Easement Agreement and IRU Agreement terms and has determined that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo to authorize the Governor to sign a form of the Easement Agreement and an IRU Agreement; and,</text>
