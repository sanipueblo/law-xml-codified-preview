    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the 2015 Court Review, Preliminary Findings Report found that, "the Court could not provide data on closed cases because the Court is missing case files from 2013-2015, and that over one hundred case files from 2013-2015, including 70 criminal cases from 2014, could not be located by the new Court Clerk;" and,</text>
