    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>in 2004, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso, as a joint owner of the SFIS Trust Lands, delegated its authority on all matters related to the governance, operation and administration of the SFIS Trust Lands to the SFIS, Inc. and its Board of Trustees, the entity also responsible for educational functions of the Santa Fe Indian School; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>in 2010, out of concern that the SFIS, Inc. was focusing on the development of the SFIS Trust Lands rather than on the educational mission of the SFIS, the Pueblo Council rescinded its 2004 resolution that granted broad governance authority to the SFIS Board of Trustees, and by its 2010 resolution, limited the delegation of Pueblo's governance authority to SFIS, Inc.; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>in 2012, the Governors continued to raise concerns that economic development and governance of the SFIS Trust Lands was taking priority over education, and directed the SFIS Inc.

    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>

      <text>in 2016, after a thorough evaluation of the need to separate governance authority for the SFIS Trust Lands and the educational authority for the SFIS, and at the request of SFIS, Inc., the Pueblo passed Resolution No. SI-R16-005 which rescinded its two prior resolutions, SI-R10-040 and SI-R15-015, and delegated governance authority over the SFIS Trust Lands to the Albuquerque Indian School District ("AISD") Governing Council; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>

      <text>the Council determined that it was in the best interest of the Pueblo and SFIS to delegate the Pueblo's authority over the SFIS Trust Lands to its Governor when sitting on the AISD Governing Council so that Governors are making governance decisions for the SFIS Trust Lands, thus allowing the Board of Trustees to focus on the educational and operational activities of the SFIS; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>

    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>despite the directive of this Pueblo's Tribal Council, and the other 18 Pueblo Tribal Councils, to move governance to the AISD Governing Council, the SFIS Board of Trustees took actions that the Council believes are contrary to the directives of this Pueblo's delegation resolution; and</text>
