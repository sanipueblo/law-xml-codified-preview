      <heading>Findings</heading>
      <text>The Council hereby finds and declares that:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(a)</num>
        <text>There are several roads within the El Rancho area of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso grant boundaries that are located almost wholly on Pueblo lands, with small portions lying on non-Indian fee lands.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>The Pueblo has completed a thorough review of the roads system in the National Tribal Transportation Facility Inventory ("NTTFI") with the focus on county named roads.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(c)</num>
        <text>The Pueblo has identified five (5) roads listed under ownership "Code 5 – County and Township" that are named as Santa Fe County Roads 84, 84A, 84B, 84C, and 84D - all located within the Pueblo's exterior boundaries;</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(d)</num>
        <text>The specific roads do not have any rights-of-way agreements between the Pueblo and Santa Fe County.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(e)</num>
        <text>There is a need to continue to maintain the roads identified as CR 84, CR 84A, CR 84B, CR 84C and CR 84D and provide safe access for the area over these roads.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(f)</num>
        <text>Placement of these roads on the NTTFI will ensure that that these roads will be maintained under the Tribal Transportation Program (TTP).</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(g)</num>
        <text>Change in the designation of these roads to "Code 1 - BIA" on the NTTFI will also allow for planning, design, improvement, realignment and construction of these roads to facilitate access to Aamodt Water Settlement infrastructure.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(h)</num>
        <text>Placement of these roads on the NTTFI requires that these roads be open available for public use which will address the majority of the private landowner access issues in the area.</text>
