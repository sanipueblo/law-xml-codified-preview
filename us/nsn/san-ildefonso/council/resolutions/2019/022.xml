  <recitals>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>cigarettes sold by a tribe, tribal entity or tribal member on tribal lands are exempt from New Mexico State cigarette tax provided that the tribe imposed a tribal tax of 75¢ per pack; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Pueblo de San Ildefonso imposes a cigarette tax on cigarettes sold on Pueblo lands and the current tax rate is 75¢ per pack; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the State of New Mexico cigarette tax rate was previously $1.66 per pack which created a price differential of 91¢ between cigarettes sold on tribal lands and cigarettes sold off-tribal lands; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the State of New Mexico cigarette tax rate increased on July 1, 2019 from $1.66 per pack to $2.00 per pack, thereby creating a price differential of $1.25 per pack between cigarette sales on Pueblo lands and sales off of Pueblo lands; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Pueblo is not required to change its tax rate as a result of the State's cigarette tax rate increase; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Pueblo has evaluated the increased price differential of $1.25 per pack between sales on Pueblo lands and sales off of Pueblo lands and has determined it is in the best interest of the Pueblo to increase the Pueblo's cigarette tax rate by 34¢ to $1.09 per pack in order to maintain a 91¢ price differential and that such tax rate change be effective November 1, 2019.</text>
    </recital>
