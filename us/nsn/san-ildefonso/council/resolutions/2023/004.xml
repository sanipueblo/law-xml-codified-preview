  <preamble>At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 24th day of March, 2023, the following law was adopted:</preamble>
  <recitals>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Council enacted the Pueblo's Gross Receipts Tax Code in 2013 to generate revenues to support the Pueblo's government, provide funding for industrial and business development, provide funding for other essential public services, and to govern the administration and enforcement of the Pueblo's gross receipts tax; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Pueblo entered into a Cooperative Agreement in 2013 with the State of New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department ("Cooperative Tax Agreement") for the reciprocal enforcement, administration and collection of gross receipts tax between the two jurisdictions; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>as required by the Cooperative Tax Agreement, the Pueblo's gross receipts tax rate is tied to the State's gross receipts tax rate and automatically increases or decreases with changes to State's gross receipts tax rate; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the State of New Mexico reduced its gross receipts tax rate in 2022 and has introduced legislation, HB 547, to reduce its gross receipts tax rate over the next four (4) years beginning in 2023; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>as a result of the previous reduction in the State's gross receipts tax rate, the Pueblo's gross receipts tax rate automatically adjusted downward resulting in a reduction in tax revenue generated on the Pueblo's lands; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>SB 147 has been introduced which would allow tribes that have cooperative tax agreements with the State of New Mexico to set their own tribal gross receipts tax rate regardless of the State's gross receipts tax rate; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>in the event that HB 547, the legislation to reduce the State's gross receipts tax, and SB 147, the legislation that allows a tribe to set its own gross receipts tax rate, are signed into law, there is the need to set the Pueblo's tax rate based on circumstances on the Pueblo as opposed to being tied to the State's gross receipts rate; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the State only allows changes to a gross receipts tax rate twice a year due to notice and publication requirements; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>to become effective July 1, any amendments must be submitted and executed by a tribe and the Taxation and Revenue Department Secretary by March 30, which may be before the Governor of New Mexico signs the applicable tax legislation into law; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Council has determined it is in the best interest of the Pueblo to decouple the Pueblo's Gross Receipts Tax rate from the State's Gross Receipts Tax rate and amend the Pueblo's Gross Receipts Tax Code to authorize the Council to establish an appropriate tribal gross receipts rate at such times to coincide with the deadlines for changes pursuant to the Cooperative Tax Agreement with the State; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Council has also determined it is the best interest of the Pueblo to establish its gross receipts tax rate at 7%, and that such rate become effective July 1, 2023; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the amendment of the Pueblo's Gross Receipts Tax Code, Section 18.1.4.050, and the establishment of the Pueblo's gross receipts tax rate shall be contingent upon the applicable State gross receipts tax rate legislation being signed into law.</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,</conjunction>
      <text>that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled, "ACT AUTHORIZING GROSS RECEIPTS TAX CODE AMENDMENT AND ESTABLISHMENT OF TRIBAL GROSS RECEIPTS TAX RATE."</text>
