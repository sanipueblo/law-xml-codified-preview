    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Pueblo currently contracts with the Northern Pueblo Housing Authority ("NPHA") to operate, manage, and administer housing programs and services for the Pueblo, including receiving and expending federal grant funds on behalf of the Pueblo as a third-party contractor; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>NPHA has experienced a number of detrimental events in the last several years including a high turnover rate in senior management positions and inadequate financial practices; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>NPHA has previously consisted of multiple northern Pueblos; however, NPHA currently consists of only two member Pueblos; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the administrative efficiencies of having multiple Pueblos sharing the costs of administrative functions has largely been lost by the departure of other member Pueblos from NPHA; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Council desires to study and evaluate the current funding and operations of the NPHA to determine the best method to provide housing programs and services to the citizens of the Pueblo, including whether to make any modifications to the structure, scope, and delivery of housing programs and services.</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,</conjunction>
      <text>that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled "NORTHERN PUEBLO HOUSING AUTHORITY EVALUATION ACT OF 2021."</text>
