    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>as part of that Easement Agreement, PNM was allowed to install ninety-six (96) fiber optic strands within two static wires on the NH Line provided that PNM was only allowed to use up to twelve (12) fiber optic lines for its internal communication purposes and was prohibited from using any other fiber optic lines for any other purpose without the written approval of the Pueblo and the Bureau of Indian Affairs ("BIA"); and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>

    </recital>
    <recital>

    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Council has been fully briefed and has reviewed the proposed Easement Agreement and IRU Agreement terms and has determined that it is in the best interest of the Pueblo to grant a limited waiver of the Pueblo's immunity from suit to enforce the Easement Agreement and an IRU Agreement and authorize the Governor to sign a form of the Easement Agreement and an IRU Agreement; and,</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
