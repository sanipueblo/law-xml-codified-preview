          <text>In 2004, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso, as a joint owner of the SFIS Trust Lands, delegated its authority on all matters related to the governance, operation and administration of the SFIS Trust Lands to the SFIS, Inc. and its Board of Trustees, the entity also responsible for educational functions of the Santa Fe Indian School.</text>

          <text>In 2010, out of concern that the SFIS, Inc. was focusing on the development of the SFIS Trust Lands rather than on the educational mission of the SFIS, the Pueblo Council rescinded its 2004 resolution that granted broad governance authority to the SFIS Board of Trustees, and by its 2010 resolution, limited the delegation of Pueblo's governance authority to SFIS, Inc.</text>

          <text>In 2012, the Governors continued to raise concerns that economic development and governance of the SFIS Trust Lands was taking priority over education, and the SFIS Inc.
