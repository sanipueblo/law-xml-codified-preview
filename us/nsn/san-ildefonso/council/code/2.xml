        <heading>Purpose</heading>
        <text>The purpose of this Act is to define the standard of conduct for ethical behavior that the Governor is expected to meet throughout the duration of his/her elected term and to provide a formal procedure for Council to remove a Governor who is found to have violated this Code of Ethics.</text>
        <text>This Code of Ethics will not ensure ethical behavior but will set standards that will lead to greater ethical awareness of expectations for the Governor, offer guidance on handling ethical problems that might arise in the course of doing business, and provide consistency in the application of removal procedures.</text>
        <text>This Code of Ethics will help guide Council discussion of any personal acts by the Governor that violate ethical behavior, which may result in a decision by the Council to prepare formal written charges seeking the removal of the Governor for alleged violations of the Code of Ethics.</text>
