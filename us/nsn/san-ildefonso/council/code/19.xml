            <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
          </text>
          <text>The Pueblo de San Ildefonso is a sovereign self-governing Nation and recognized as such by the United States of America.  The Pueblo Tribal Council is the governing body and has legislative and other responsibilities for the Pueblo in its exercise of its inherent sovereign powers.  A primary objective of the Tribal Council is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth.</text>
          <text>This Policy is designed to acquaint you with the Pueblo and provide you with information about working conditions, employee benefits, and some of the policies affecting your employment.  It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and outlines the programs developed by the Pueblo to benefit employees.  It is your responsibility to read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Policy.</text>
          <text>One of our objectives is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth.</text>
          <text>No Personnel Policy can anticipate every circumstance or question.  Over time, the need may arise and the Pueblo reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies as the Tribal Council deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. Employees will be notified appropriately of such changes.</text>
          <text>These policies and procedures shall apply to all employees of the Pueblo.</text>

              <strong>GENERAL EMPLOYMENT POLICIES</strong>
            </text>
            <text>
              <strong>101. Nature of Employment</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Employment with the Pueblo is "at-will" so that employment is voluntarily entered into by the employee and the employee is free to resign at any time, with or without cause. Similarly, the Pueblo is free to terminate the employment at any time, with or without cause.  Employees may be given the right to pursue grievance procedures.</text>
            <text>This Policy is not a contract. The policies set forth are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations, express or implied, to remain employed by the Pueblo. Nor does it guarantee any fixed terms or conditions of employment. Nothing in any policy or work rule of the Pueblo shall alter the at-will employment relationship between the Pueblo and its employees.</text>
            <text>This Policy is intended to provide employees with a general understanding of employment with the Pueblo. However, this Policy cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about employment. Therefore, in order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, the Pueblo reserves the right to alter, delete, or add to any of the provisions of the Policy and to change, modify, suspend, cancel or interpret any of the personnel policies and practices or employee benefits which are described herein without notice to employees whenever the Tribal Council determines, in its sole discretion, that such action is warranted and without having to give cause or justification or consideration to any employee.</text>
            <text>These provisions supersede all existing policies and practices and may not be amended or added to without the express written approval of the Pueblo Tribal Council. It is the responsibility of the Tribal Administrator to notify all employees of changes made to the content of the Policy in a timely fashion.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>102. Equal Employment Opportunity</strong>
            </text>
            <text>In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at the Pueblo will be based on performance, job qualifications, and experience. The Pueblo does not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law. However, the Pueblo will give preference in employment to qualified American Indians and Pueblo Tribal members as described by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and other applicable laws.</text>
            <text>This policy applies to all employment practices, including recruiting, hiring, evaluation, promotion, transfer, discipline and termination, as well as all forms of employee compensation. All of the Pueblo's policies will be interpreted to permit and promote reasonable accommodation of the disabilities and religious beliefs and practices of otherwise qualified employees and applicants, except where such accommodation causes undue hardship to the Pueblo. The extent of an obligation is determined by the Pueblo of San Ildefonso's needs, financial costs and expense, in conformity with applicable law.</text>
            <text>Every employee is expected to conform to this policy, to accomplish work in a professional and businesslike manner, and to be courteous to all other employees, contractors, business associates, customers, guests, and visitors at all times. Discrimination against or harassment of any employee or other person because of race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry or disability is strictly prohibited.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>103. Business Ethics and Conduct</strong>
            </text>
            <text>The successful operation and reputation of the Pueblo is built upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of our employees. Employees owe a duty to the Pueblo, its community members and the Tribal Council to act in a way that will merit the continued trust and confidence of the public. Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a positive and professional manner so as to promote the best interests of the Pueblo.</text>
            <text>The Pueblo will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its employees to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of all applicable laws and regulations and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.</text>
            <text>In general, the use of good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide employees with respect to lines of acceptable conduct. If a situation arises where it is difficult to determine the proper course of action, the matter will be referred to the Tribal Administrator who will make a final determination on the issue. Conduct that interferes with operations, discredits, or is offensive the Pueblo, the public, or fellow employees will not be tolerated.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>104. Conflicts of Interest</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. Employees are expected, at all times, to act in the best interest of the Pueblo.</text>
            <text>Transactions with outside firms<sup>-</sup> must be conducted within a framework established and controlled by the Governor of the Pueblo. Business dealings with outside firms should not result in unusual gains for those firms or employees. Unusual gain refers to bribes, product bonuses, special fringe benefits, unusual price breaks, and other windfalls designed to ultimately benefit the employer, the employee, or both. Plans that could be interpreted to involve unusual gain require specific approval from the Tribal Council.</text>
            <text>An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of the Pueblo's business dealings.</text>
            <text>However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they disclose to the Tribal Administrator the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties.</text>
            <text>Personal gain may occur not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership in a firm with which the Pueblo does business, but also when an employee or relative receives special consideration or unusual gain as a result of any transaction or business dealing.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>105. Outside Employment</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Unless a conflict of interest is created, an employee may hold a job with another organization as long as that employee, first, obtains the written acknowledgment from their Director and, second, continues to satisfactorily perform their job responsibilities with the Pueblo. The second job cannot interfere with the position held with the Pueblo of San Ildefonso.   All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to the Pueblo's scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements.</text>
            <text>If the Pueblo determines that an employee's outside work interferes with performance or the ability to meet the requirements of the Pueblo, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment as a condition of remaining employed by the Pueblo.</text>
            <text>Outside employment will present a conflict of interest if it has an adverse impact on the Pueblo or otherwise is inconsistent with the provisions of Section 104 Conflicts of Interest.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>106. Dress Code</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Dress, grooming, and personal cleanliness standards contribute to the morale of all employees and affect the business image the Pueblo presents to community members and visitors. Attire should be clean, tasteful, non-offensive and non-revealing.</text>
            <text>During business hours, employees are expected to present a clean and neat appearance and to dress according to the requirements of their positions. Employees who appear for work inappropriately dressed will be sent home and directed to return to work in proper attire. Under such circumstances, employees will not be compensated for the time away from work.</text>
            <text>Consult your Director or supervisor if you have questions as to what constitutes appropriate attire.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>107. Confidentiality</strong>
            </text>
            <text>The protection of confidential business information, trade secrets and Tribal information is vital to the interests and the success of the Pueblo. Such confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following:</text>
            <text>
              <ul>
                <li>Personnel Records</li>
                <li>Enrollment Files and Data</li>

                <li>Pueblo Customs, Rites and Traditions</li>
              </ul>
            </text>
            <text>In addition, certain files and documents kept by a federally funded program may be considered as part of the federal recordkeeping system and may be subject to the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text>All employees are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement as a condition of employment. Employees who improperly use or disclose trade secrets or confidential business information will be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment and legal action, even if they do not benefit from the disclosed information.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>RECRUITMENT</strong>
            </text>
            <text>
              <strong>201. Personnel Selection Committee</strong>
            </text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>a.</num>
            <text>) For each vacancy the Tribal Administrator, in consultation with the Governor, shall appoint an Ad Hoc Personnel Selection Committee. The selection committee may be composed of two or more individuals including the Human Resources Director, the Department Director, and at least one Councilman knowledgeable in the field. The role of the Personnel Selection Committee shall be to review applications, evaluate applicants for employment based on job qualifications and experience, and recommend final selection of applicants to the Tribal Administrator and/or Governor. Immediate family members may not serve on the same personnel selection committee, nor may immediate family members of an interviewee serve on the Personnel Selection Committee evaluating that interviewee.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>b.</num>
            <text>) The Committee must display fairness, honesty and integrity in the execution of its duties as Personnel Selection Committee members in screening and selecting employees for the Pueblo. If the Personnel Selection Committee or an individual member sees a conflict of interest arise, that person will remove themselves or be asked to remove themselves.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>c.</num>
            <text>) The Tribal Council reserves the right to make the final decision or approve the final decision on the hiring of high level management positions.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>202. Job Vacancies and Employee Transfers</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Job vacancies will first be posted on the employee bulletin board and within the community of the Pueblo. Announcements may be sent to other recruiting sources and publications as applicable. It is within the sole discretion of the Pueblo to fill a vacancy with an existing employee or hire a new employee from outside of the Pueblo. Each job posting notice will include the job title, department, location, job summary, essential duties, qualifications, and the closing date for receipt of applications.</text>
            <text>To be eligible to apply for a posted job, employees must have performed competently for at least ninety (90) calendar days in their current position. Employees who have not completed any corrective action issued in connection with a written warning, or who are on probation or suspension, are not eligible to apply for posted jobs. When an applicant is considered for a position, the hiring supervisor or Director will contact the applicant's Director to verify performance, skills, and attendance.</text>
            <text>Upon transfer to another program, an employee, at the discretion of the Pueblo, may be compensated for 50% of any accrued annual leave to be paid by the program from which the employee is transferring. The remaining accrued annual leave and all sick leaves shall be carried over to the new program. This policy is meant to prevent the new program from bearing the burden of carrying and covering the full amount of accrued annual leave for a transferred employee.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>203. Employment Applications</strong>
            </text>
            <text>All applicants shall complete a Pueblo Employment Application Form. The Pueblo relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application, as well as the accuracy of other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this data may result in the Pueblo's exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if the person has been hired, termination of employment.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>204. Employment Reference Checks and Background Investigation</strong>
            </text>
            <text>It is the policy of the Pueblo to check the employment references of all applicants.  Background investigations will be conducted on business managers for businesses operated by the Pueblo and not its corporation, financial managers, controller and assistant controller.  These financial positions do not require an FBI Criminal History Records Search.</text>
            <text>It is the policy of the Pueblo that background investigations, and reinvestigations every five years, shall be conducted on those individuals in positions covered by Public Law 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act for the protection of children and of the elderly.  A favorable background investigation meeting the minimum standards of inquiries identified in federal regulations is a condition of employment for individuals working with, having regular contact with or having control over children and the elderly.</text>
            <text>Covered programs include but are not limited to the following:   (1) All Health and Human Services programs including Community Health Representative Program, Diabetes Program;, Health Coalition,  Senior Citizens Center, and the Indian Child Welfare Act Program; and (2) all Education programs including the Language Program, Recreation and Youth, the Parks and Wildlife Program and (3) the Tribal Courts.  Each of the individuals must meet the minimum standards of character prescribed by federal laws and regulations to work in such programs or positions.</text>
            <text>The Background Investigations Program is designed to meet the minimum standards of investigative inquiries identified by federal laws and regulations.  The Background investigation process requires investigation of individuals applying for or working in a paid or voluntary capacity, whether short term or long term, and includes:</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>1.</num>
            <text>FBI Criminal History Records Search via fingerprint checks.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>2.</num>
            <text>State Repository Check - Criminal history checks within each state that the individual identifies as a former residence and each place of work for the last 5 years.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>3.</num>
            <text>Local Law Enforcement Check - Law enforcement agency check (including tribal entities) within each state or jurisdiction that the individual identifies as a former residence and each place of work for the last 5 years.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>4.</num>
            <text>Record/Reference Check from Former Employer - Record check for former employer(s) for the last 5 years.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>5.</num>
            <text>Personal Reference Checks - At least three (3) reference contacts.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>6.</num>
            <text>Record Check of Former School - Verification of last degree.</text>
            <text>The minimum standards of character prescribed by federal law and this Policy shall ensure that none of the individuals appointed to positions in the programs described above have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, (1) any felonious offense, or any of two or more misdemeanor offenses, under Federal or  State law involving crimes of violence;, sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact or prostitution; (2) crimes against persons; or (3) offenses committed against children or elderly under Federal or State law. Any conviction in tribal court is not considered a felony.</text>
            <text>
              <u>Suitability Determinations</u>
            </text>
            <text>The Human Resources Director is the designated Suitability Official who determines suitability of prospective employees for employment and efficiency of service. The Pueblo may appoint one additional Suitability Official. The Suitability determination process protects the interests of the Pueblo and the rights of applicants and employees. The Suitability Determination Process requires uniform evaluation to ensure fair and consistent judgment.</text>
            <text>The Suitability Official is the designated representative for the Pueblo who directs proper background investigations and suitability determinations.  The Suitability Official must be qualified for the position and the responsibilities of his/her office and must have a favorable background investigation and suitability determination. The Suitability Official receives and is responsible for the results of the fingerprint checks and all other background investigations.  All precautions shall be taken to guarantee confidentiality.</text>
            <text>The Suitability Official should have a balanced, unbiased approach in the review of all investigations.  Potential conflicts of interest shall be avoided.  There are potential problems if the Suitability Official personally knows the subject of the investigation. Where a conflict of interest exists, the Tribal Administrator shall act as a temporary Suitability Official to conduct the background Investigation. A subordinate should not make a suitability determination for his/her immediate supervisor.</text>
            <text>The suitability determination process involves an assessment of past and present conduct that may indicate probable future actions with adverse impact on the efficiency of the interests of the Pueblo and which may violate Public Law 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act.</text>
            <text>
              <u>Criteria for Suitability Standards</u>
            </text>
            <text>The assessment of suitability is made to establish a reasonable expectation that the employment or continued employment of a person either would or would not promote the interests and the efficiency of the Pueblo. This determination is based on considerations of whether the conduct of the person indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on (1) the performance of the person in the position applied for or employed in; (2) the accomplishment of the duties and responsibilities of others in the Pueblo; or (3) the ability of the Pueblo to fully and effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.</text>
            <text>
              <u>Determination Factors for Suitability Standards</u>
            </text>
            <text>In determining potential impact on the efficiency of the service, two issues are considered:</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>(1)</num>
            <text>Whether the conduct in question indicates a potential for inadequate or reduced accomplishment of specific duties; and (2) whether the conduct indicates any immediate or long-term risk for abuse of trust in carrying out the responsibilities of the position. Conduct paralleling any of the following factors may be considered as a basis for disqualification:</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>a.</num>
            <text>Delinquency or misconduct in prior employment;</text>

            <text>Abuse of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances.</text>
            <text>The Suitability Official shall consider the following additional factors to the extent that these factors are deemed pertinent to the individual case:</text>

          <para>
            <num>a.</num>

The Suitability Official must obtain concurrence on a suitability decision from the Governor or Lt. Governor.  The Certificate of Investigation is signed and dated by the Suitability Official and the Governor or Lt. Governor and placed in the employee's personnel file.  The supporting documentation to the favorable determination can then be destroyed.  The appropriate personnel will be notified that the employee has been cleared.</text>
            <text>In cases in which the Suitability Official with the concurrence of the Governor or Lt.

            <text>In cases in which a former employee of the Pueblo requires a reference regarding new employment, such reference request must be submitted in writing to the Human Resources Department.  The response of the Human Resources Department shall be in writing and, except as otherwise required by law, will be limited to confirming only dates of employment, wage rates, and position(s) held. If a former employee would like the prospective employer to be provided with more information, that former employee must provide a written and signed authorization and release to their prior direct supervisor.</text>

              <strong>205. Hiring of Relatives</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Although the Pueblo has no prohibition against hiring relatives of existing employees, we are committed to monitoring situations in which relatives work in the same area. The employment of relatives in the same area of an organization may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day-to-day working relationships.</text>
            <text>In case of actual or potential problems between or among relatives who work in the same area, the Pueblo may monitor the problem and may take prompt action to attempt to resolve the problem. This may include reassignment or, if necessary because no resolution is possible, one or both employees may be required to resign or be terminated.</text>
            <text>A "relative" as used in this Policy is any person who is related by blood or marriage in the immediate family or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage. The term includes employees who become related after employment.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>EMPLOYMENT STATUS &amp; RECORDS</strong>
            </text>
            <text>
              <strong>301. Employment Categories</strong>
            </text>
            <text><strong>Regular Full-Time: </strong>Employees who are not in a Temporary or Probationary status and who are regularly scheduled to work the Pueblo's full-time schedule which, in general, is thirty-two (32) or more hours per week. Generally, regular full-time employees are eligible for the Pueblo de San Ildefonso's benefits.</text>
            <text><strong>Part-Time: </strong>Employees who are not assigned in a Temporary or Probationary status and who are regularly scheduled to work less than thirty-two (32) hours per week. Part-Time employees are generally ineligible for the Pueblo's benefits, unless otherwise expressly provided, in writing.</text>
            <text><strong>Contract: </strong>A contract employee is an individual who provides services as stipulated in a contract/subcontract agreement and is not eligible for the rights and benefits of Pueblo. All employee contracts shall be reviewed and approved by the Governor and Tribal Administrator.  All proper documentation shall be submitted to the Tribal Administrator including the contract and budget justification.</text>
            <text><strong>Probationary: </strong>Employees whose performance is being evaluated to determine whether further employment in a specific position with the Pueblo is appropriate. Employees who satisfactorily complete the probationary period of ninety (90) calendar days will be notified of their new employment classification. The probationary period may be extended to continue assessment of the employee's performance. The probationary period will be extended by the same amount of days that have been authorized and taken as leave during the probationary period as described in Section 303. The employee shall be terminated if job performance during the probationary period is not satisfactory. Probationary employees accrue annual and sick leave from the date of hire, however, use of such leave by probationary employees during the probationary period is not authorized except in extraordinary circumstances as determined by the immediate supervisor and the Tribal Administrator.</text>
            <text><strong>Temporary: </strong>Employees who are hired as interim replacements to temporarily supplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project or as an emergency hire. Employment assignments in this category are of a limited duration (90-Day or unless a waiver granted for the Governor for an extension). Employment beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain that status unless and until notified of a change. Temporary employees are ineligible for the Pueblo's benefits, unless otherwise expressly provided.</text>
            <text><strong>Exempt Employees</strong>:  Employees in positions classified in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA is the acronym for Federal Labor Standards Act of 1938 as amended), are exempt and shall not be eligible for overtime pay because of supervisory, managerial, professional, or otherwise exercise independent judgment and discretion in the performance of their job duties.   Exempt employees will be compensated on the basis of an annual salary.  Overtime and Compensatory Time refer to Section 411.</text>
            <text><strong>Non-Exempt Employees: </strong>Employees in positions classified in accordance with the FLSA which are eligible for overtime pay at a rate of one and one-half times (1 1/2 ) their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week. Nonexempt employees will be compensated on an hourly basis. For Overtime and Compensatory Time refer to Section 411.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>302. Job Descriptions</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Job descriptions shall be developed for each employee of the Pueblo. The employee shall be required to read their job description and shall acknowledge complete agreement with the stated responsibilities by signing the description.</text>
            <text>The job description shall be a part of the employee's personnel file.</text>
            <text><strong>303</strong>. <strong>Probationary Period</strong></text>
            <text>The probationary period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position meets their expectations. The Pueblo de San Ildefonso uses this period to evaluate employees' capabilities, work habits, and overall performance. All new, transferred and rehired employees work on a probationary basis for the first ninety (90) calendar days after their date of hire or transfer.</text>
            <text>A probationary employee may be terminated or transferred at will during the probationary period when his or her abilities or performance are judged insufficient by the immediate supervisor. Transferred employees may be reinstated to their former positions, or an equivalent position they are qualified for, provided such a position is available.</text>
            <text>New employees are not eligible to receive benefits within the probationary period. New employees will accrue annual and sick leave from the date of hire but are generally not eligible to use or be paid for such leave during the probationary period except in extraordinary circumstances as determined by the immediate supervisor and Tribal Administrator.</text>
            <text>Upon satisfactory completion of the probationary period, the probationary employee shall become either a Regular Full-Time or Regular Part-Time employee. However, successful completion of the probationary period does not modify or change the employee's "at-will" status and does not entitle an employee to an automatic increase in pay for the change to a "regular employee" status.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>304. Performance Evaluation</strong>
            </text>
            <text>A formal written performance evaluation will be conducted at the end of an employee's initial period of hire, known as the probationary period. Additional formal performance evaluations are conducted to provide both Directors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting goals. This clause applies to new hires, rehires and transferred employees.</text>
            <text>The Tribal Administrator and Governor will evaluate the Directors. The Governor and Tribal Council will evaluate the Tribal Administrator.</text>
            <text>Directors and supervisors will conduct performance evaluations of all their employees on a 12-month cycle, beginning at the employee's date of hire.</text>
            <text>At the discretion of the Director or Tribal Administrator, evaluations may be conducted on a more frequent basis.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>305. Personal Data Changes</strong>
            </text>
            <text>It is the responsibility of each employee to promptly notify the Pueblo of any changes in personal data. Names, personal mailing addresses, telephone numbers, number and names of dependents, individuals to be contacted in the event of emergency, educational accomplishments, and other such status reports should be accurate and current at all times. If any personal data has changed, notify the Human Resources Department.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>306. Access to Personnel Files</strong>
            </text>
            <text>The Pueblo maintains a personnel file on each employee. The personnel file includes the employee's job application, resume, job description, records of training, documentation of performance appraisals and salary increases, disciplinary action and other employment records.</text>
            <text>Personnel files are the property of the Pueblo, and access to the information they contain is restricted to the employee, the employee's Director and/or Supervisor, and Administrative Management personnel of the Pueblo with a legitimate reason to review information in an employee's file.</text>
            <text>Employees may review their own personnel files, with advance notice, in the presence of the Human Resources Director.   Employees will be notified of any request by an outside agency to view their personnel file.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>EMPLOYEE BENEFITS</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Eligible employees are provided benefits by the Pueblo for the welfare of employees and these benefits are not to be abused. Employees with questions about any of the benefits provided by the Pueblo should ask their Director or the Human Resources Director.</text>
            <text>In case of a conflict between any benefit described in this Policy or in a specific plan, summary plan description, or other legal document, the language of the specific plan, shall prevail, unless otherwise expressly stated in writing.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>401. Annual Leave</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Annual leave with pay is available to eligible employees to provide opportunities for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. Annual Leave is <strong>scheduled </strong>leave that is provided to Regular Full-Time Employees upon successful completion of the probationary period.</text>
            <text>Employees who have worked for the Pueblo for less than three (3) years shall receive fourteen days Annual Leave per year. Employees who have worked for the Pueblo for between three (3) to seven (7) years shall receive sixteen (16) days annual leave per year. Employees who have worked for the Pueblo for more than seven (7) years shall receive eighteen (18) days annual leave per year. Employees may take their Annual Leave at any time during the year with prior approval from their Director.</text>
            <text>Accrual of Annual Leave shall end on December 31, 2008 and shall not be carried over from year to year beginning January 1, 2009. Annual leave accrued through 2008 will be paid out if not used by February 28, 2009. For the year 2009, Annual Leave will be budgeted for Employees in the full annual amount stated above starting on March 1, 2009. Starting in 2010, Annual Leave will be budgeted in the full annual amounted stated above to eligible employees on January 1, 2010 and on January 1<sup>st</sup> of each year thereafter. Employees hired after January 1 in any year will have Annual Leave budgeted in an amount pro-rated to the nearest month of employment remaining for that year and whole day of leave, as determined by the Tribal Administrator.</text>
            <text>For Annual Leave which requires more than five (5) consecutive days of leave, the employee should submit an Annual Leave request no later than one week prior to the scheduled dates and obtain prior approval from their Director. A request for annual leave will be granted at the discretion of the supervisor and/or Director.</text>
            <text>Any Annual Leave unused at the end of employment will not be paid.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>402. Sick Leave</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Sick Leave can be <strong>scheduled </strong>or <strong>unscheduled </strong>leave that is provided to Regular Full-Time employees. Sick Leave is provided to employees after successful completion of the probationary period.</text>
            <text>As of March 1, 2009 for 2009, and on January 1 of each year starting with 2010, each employee is entitled to twelve (12) days of sick leave each year. Sick Leave may be authorized when an employee is incapacitated by sickness or injury; for medical, dental, or optical diagnosis or treatment; when the Employee's attendance jeopardizes the health of others; or for the care of immediate family members in the event of serious illness. Employees hired after January 1 in any year will have Sick Leave in an amount pro-rated to the nearest month of employment remaining for that year and whole day of leave, as determined by the Tribal Administrator.</text>
            <text>Employees must notify their director as soon as possible if they will miss work due to sickness, but no later than the beginning of the scheduled work day. Requests for sick leave can be made in advance if known (scheduled), but must be submitted within one day after returning to work after sick leave has been used (unscheduled). A physician's verification may be required at any time a director feels that sick leave is being abused.</text>
            <text>Upon separation of employment with the Pueblo, any unused Sick Leave will not be paid.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>403. Bereavement Leave</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Employees who must take time off due to the death of an immediate family member must notify their Director immediately. A Regular Full-Time employee will be paid for up to four (4) days of Bereavement Leave per year.</text>
            <text>Annual or Sick Leave may be used for time off work for bereavement in all other instances. Administrative leave may be granted at the sole discretion of the Governor.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>404. Family and Medical Leave Of Absence</strong>
            </text>
            <text>In accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Pueblo provides family leave of absence, without pay, to eligible employees for birth or adoption or foster placement of a child, serious health conditions of a child, the serious health condition of a parent or spouse, or the employee's own serious health condition.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>General Guidelines</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text>Employees may be eligible to take an unpaid family or medical leave of up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12-month period for the following reasons, as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993:</text>
            <text>The birth of a child of an employee or the placement of a child with the 	employee for adoption or foster care. Entitlement to leave for the birth or placement 	of a child for adoption or foster care expires 12 months from the date of birth or 	placement of the child.</text>
            <text>To care for a spouse, child or parent who has a serious health condition.</text>
            <text>Because of a serious health condition of the employee.</text>
            <text>In cases where both spouses are employed by the Pueblo, the combined period of their family and medical leave will be limited to 12 workweeks in any 12-month period, for birth or adoption of a child. In all other instances, including covered health conditions of the employee or the employee's spouse, parent or child, each spouse is entitled to his or her own full 12 weeks of family leave.</text>
            <text>The amount of leave that an employee is entitled to at any given time will be determined on a rolling 12-month period, measured backward from the date an employee uses any leave, as defined under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.</text>
            <text>All employees are required to designate brief absences as FMLA leave within two (2) days following their return from leave if the Pueblo has not previously designated this absence as FMLA leave. If an employee fails to designate the leave at that time, they may not be able to qualify that absence as FMLA leave at a later date.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Employee Eligibility</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text>To be eligible for unpaid family and medical leave, an employee must be qualified under the terms of the Family and Medical Leave Act, meaning, the employee must:</text>
            <text>
              <ul>
                <li>Have worked for the Pueblo at least 12 months.</li>
                <li>Have at least 1250 hours of service during the 12-month period prior to the leave.</li>
              </ul>
            </text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Benefits While On Leave</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text>During an approved family and medical leave, an employee is entitled to receive health benefits at the same level and terms of coverage as if they had been working throughout the leave.</text>
            <text>An employee is not entitled to the accrual of any seniority or leave benefits that would have accrued if not for the taking of leave. Annual leave and sick leave will be suspended during the leave period and will resume upon return to active employment. An employee who takes family or medical leave will not lose any seniority or leave benefits that accrued before the date leave began.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Restoration Of Employment After Leave</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text>The Pueblo will reinstate an employee returning from family and medical leave to the same or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. However, an employee on leave does not have a greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the leave period. An employee may be requested to submit a physician's release to return to work if leave was for his or her own health condition.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Status Reports While On Leave</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text>Employees on family leave may be required, on a periodic basis, to report their status and intent to return, to designated Pueblo representatives.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Substitution of Accrued/Earned Time Off</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text>The Pueblo requires employees to first substitute all accrued/earned Annual Leave and Sick Leave as part or all of the 12 work week period. After all paid leave has been exhausted; any time remaining in the 12 work week period must be taken without pay.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Care for a Child After Childbirth or Adoption or Foster Care Placement</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text>Scheduling/Notice: Family leaves taken for childbirth or adoption or foster care placement must be taken within 12 months of the birth or the adoption or foster care placement.</text>
            <text>Employees must notify Pueblo thirty (30) days in advance or give as much advance notice as is practical depending upon conditions.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Care for Spouse, Child_ or Parent or Employee's Own Serious Health Condition</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text>Scheduling/Notice: An employee requesting family leave due to their own serious health condition or for the serious health condition of their spouse, child, or parent, must notify both their Director and the Tribal Administrator thirty (30) days in advance or give as much advance notice as is practical depending on conditions.</text>
            <text>Certification: The Pueblo requires a written explanation from the covered family member's physician or the employee's physician of the need for family leave, in both the case of an employee's own serious health condition and that of a covered family member. The Pueblo of San Ildefonso will require written approval from the employee's treating physician of fitness to return to work for an employee's own serious health condition.</text>
            <text>The Pueblo reserves the right to review all information about medical certifications in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Full Time versus Intermittent Leave</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text>Employees may request intermittent or reduced leave schedules. If the necessity for the leave is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, employees must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt the operations of the Pueblo. In addition, the employee shall provide as much notice of the request to take such leave as practicably possible.</text>
            <text>The Pueblo requires employees to provide a written explanation from the employee's physician of the dates and duration of the expected treatment, as well as the medical necessity for intermittent or reduced leave schedule.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Temporary Transfers</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text>An employee who requests such an intermittent or reduced leave schedule may be temporarily transferred to an alternative position, if such a position is available, having equivalent pay and benefits that the employee is qualified for and that better accommodates recurring periods of leave, as determined by Pueblo.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>405. Other Unpaid Personal Leave Of Absence</strong>
            </text>
            <text>Unpaid personal leaves of absence may be granted for reasons other than those specified in this Policy. Any employee who wants a personal leave of absence must place such request in writing, including the reason and duration of such leave, and submit that request to the Director/Tribal Administrator. The Tribal Administrator and the Governor, within their sole discretion, will make a determination on the request jointly. In making that decision, the needs and concern of the employee are balanced with the demands of the Pueblo. In some cases, the Pueblo may grant a leave for a lesser period of time than that requested by the employee. All accrued/earned leave must be exhausted before a personal leave of absence will be granted.</text>
            <text>At the time such leave is granted, the Pueblo will inform the employee whether they are to be reinstated to their regular position. If during such a leave of absence, it is necessary to fill the position of the employee on leave, that employee will be so informed and will have the option of immediately returning to work in the position held prior to the leave, or in a different capacity as determined by the Pueblo.</text>
            <text>Benefit accruals such as annual leave and sick leave will be suspended during the leave period and will resume upon return to active employment.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>406. Holidays</strong>

While it is recognized that absences will occur for any number of valid reasons, it is the expectation of the Pueblo that employees be responsible about their jobs and that they maintain an excellent attendance record.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>501. Definitions</strong>

            <text><strong>"Lateness"</strong> - The late arrival or early departure from the workstation at any time during an employee's regularly assigned schedule. Lateness is measured from the first occurrence and continuously thereafter. EXCEPTION: If lateness is due to problems with transportation, weather emergencies and the like, and at the discretion of the employee's supervisor, the employee may make up the lost time during the day. In such cases, the lateness will be deleted from the employee's record.</text>
            <text><strong>"Excessive Lost Time" - </strong>An emerging pattern of absenteeism and/or lateness. An employee may be terminated for excessive episodes of absence or lateness.</text>

            </text>
            <text>Accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every employee. Federal laws require the Pueblo to keep an accurate record of time worked in order to calculate employee pay and benefits. Time worked is the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties.</text>
            <text>Altering, falsifying, tampering with timesheets, or recording time on another employee's timesheet may result in disciplinary action including termination of employment.</text>
            <text>It is the employees' responsibility to sign their timesheets to certify the accuracy of all time recorded. The Director will review and sign the timesheet before submitting it for payroll processing.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>503. Work Schedules</strong>
            </text>
            <text>The normal work schedule for all Regular Full-Time employees is eight (8) hours a day, five (5) days a week. Monday through Friday, 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. with a one (1) hour lunch break. Staffing needs and operational demands may necessitate variations in starting and ending times, as well as variations in the total hours that may be scheduled each day and week. Scheduling is at the discretion of the Governor and may be changed at any time to suit the requirements of the Pueblo.</text>
            <text>Employees shall have the privilege of two breaks per day with a one-hour lunch break, except where the press of business makes such breaks inappropriate. One fifteen (15) minute break shall be taken in the morning and one fifteen (15) minute break in the afternoon.</text>
            <text>Flexible scheduling, or flextime, is available in some cases to allow employees to vary their starting and ending times each day within established limits. Flextime may be possible if a mutually workable schedule can be negotiated with the Director involved. However, such issues as staffing needs, the employee's performance, and the nature of the job will be considered before approval of flextime.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>504. Separation from Employment</strong>
            </text>
            <text>The Pueblo will implement the separation of employees from employment as appropriate and necessary. All those concerned will treat any separation from employment in a professional and confidential manner.</text>
            <text>Separation from employment is normally implemented by one of the following actions and shall be done in accordance with the stated policies and procedures:</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Voluntary Separation</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text><u>Resignation:</u> This is a voluntary separation of employment initiated by the employee. An employee wishing to terminate employment in good standing is expected to give as much advance notice as possible. Two (2) weeks or ten (10) working days is generally considered sufficient notice time. A voluntary resignation should be done in writing by the employee and confirmed in writing by the supervisor/director. A confirmed resignation may be withdrawn by written request of the employee and at the sole discretion and written approval of the Governor.</text>
            <text>An employee absent from work without authorization or without notifying their supervisor for three (3) consecutive days, may be deemed to have effected a voluntary "no call/no show" resignation.</text>
            <text>An employee, who voluntarily resigns from employment, shall be entitled to receive all earned wages subject to deductions for any indebtedness or unreturned property. Payment for earned hours shall be processed as quickly as possible within two weeks after the date of resignation but is subject to the following time constraints: verification of time worked, return of equipment, calculation of any costs owed to the Pueblo by the employee, and other indebtedness.</text>
            <text>
              <strong>
                <u>Involuntary Separation</u>
              </strong>
            </text>
            <text><u>Discharge:</u> This is defined as an involuntary termination of employment from the Pueblo for substandard performance, or misconduct, or at any time during the probationary period. Employees may be terminated in accordance with their at-will employment status. An employee may be discharged when in the judgment of the administration the seriousness of the matter is such that the employee cannot be permitted to remain on the workforce.</text>

            <heading>Substandard Performance:</heading>
            <text>An employee may be discharged from employment if their 	performance is unacceptable. It is important for Directors and supervisors to identify 	potential performance deficiencies or problems as early as possible and take prompt 	measures in an attempt to correct the situation in consultation with the Tribal 	Administrator to avoid termination. However, this process may not apply for a 	discharge of an employee during the probationary period. Before discharging any 	employee, a supervisor must consult with the Tribal Administrator and Governor 	who must concur in advance of notifying the employee of discharge action.</text>

              <heading>Misconduct:</heading>
              <text>The Pueblo reserves the right to either 1) suspend or terminate an 	employee immediately upon the occurrence of misconduct or 2) subject the</text>
              <text>employee to	its progressive discipline policy to be engaged in activities such as, 	but not limited to, theft of the Pueblo tribal property or the property of another 	employee, insubordination, assault, harassment (see Section 606) or any other 	activities showing willful disregard of the Pueblo interests or policies. It is 	important for Directors and supervisors to identify potential performance 	deficiencies or problems as early as possible and take prompt measures in an 	attempt to correct the situation in consultation with the Tribal Administrator.</text>
              <text>If a possibility of continuing misconduct requires that action be taken before consultation 	with the Tribal Administrator and Governor can take place or if the misconduct is so 	serious, a Director may suspend the employee temporarily. Pending the results of further 	review and investigation by the Tribal Administrator and Governor, the suspension may 	be with or without pay. Refer to Section 704 (3)</text>

              <heading>Discharge during the Probationary Period:</heading>
              <text>The probationary period is a period of 	service during which Pueblo assesses the performance of an employee to determine 	whether the employee satisfactorily meets the requirements of the position. The 	termination of a probationary employee during the probationary period may be 	without cause but requires the approval of the appropriate Director, Tribal 	Administrator</text>
              <text>or the Governor.</text>
              <text>A probationary employee who is discharged during the probationary period shall only be entitled to pay for any hours worked.</text>
              <text>An employee who is involuntarily separated from employment shall be entitled to receive all earned pay subject to deductions for any indebtedness or unreturned property. Payment for earned hours shall be processed as quickly as possible after the date of termination but is subject to the following time constraints: verification of time worked, return of equipment, calculation of any costs owed to the Pueblo by the employee, other indebtedness, completion of specific projects, etc.</text>

              </text>
              <text>In keeping with the Pueblo intent to provide a safe and healthy work environment, smoking in the workplace is prohibited and permitted only in designated areas. This policy applies equally to all employees, community members, and visitors.</text>
              <text>
                <strong>603. Use of Equipment and Vehicles</strong>
              </text>
              <text>Equipment and vehicles essential in accomplishing job duties are expensive and may be difficult to replace. When using Pueblo property, employees are expected to exercise care, perform required maintenance, and follow all operating instructions, safety standards, and guidelines. Only authorized personnel may use equipment and vehicles. Employees' must be insurable and may require certification or training.</text>
              <text>The Director should be notified if any equipment, machines, tools, or vehicles appear to be damaged, defective, or in need of repair. Prompt reporting of damages, defects, and the need for repairs could prevent deterioration of equipment and possible injury to employees or others.</text>
              <text>The improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of equipment or vehicles, as well as excessive or avoidable traffic and parking violations, can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Employees are required to notify their supervisor if their driver's license becomes invalid for any reason if the operation of a motor vehicle is an integral or required part of the employee's job duties.</text>

              <text>To provide for the safety and security of employees and the facilities at the Pueblo, only authorized visitors are allowed in the workplace. Restricting unauthorized visitors helps maintain safety standards, protects against theft, ensures security of equipment, protects confidential information, safeguards employee welfare, and avoids potential distractions and disturbances.</text>
              <text>Employees are responsible for the conduct and safety of their visitors.  If an unauthorized individual is observed on the Pueblo's premises, employees should immediately notify the Administrative Receptionist or, if necessary, direct the individual to the reception area.</text>
              <text>
                <strong>605. Use of Information Systems and Networks</strong>
              </text>
              <text>The Pueblo's information systems (IS) - networks, software, and computers - are valuable company assets, provided to employees as tools to function competitively in our business. Limited non-business use of them is permissible when it does not interfere with business use of the systems and is consistent with job responsibilities, other Pueblo policies, ethical considerations and all applicable laws. Employees must understand that such non-business use creates no privacy right for any data stored on Pueblo information systems or any data sent over Pueblo networks.</text>
              <text>The Pueblo reserves the right to access, review, and exclude material transmitted over or stored in these systems and networks and may terminate any activity related to its systems and networks which is believed to be inappropriate or in violation of policies. Failure to adhere to these requirements may result in the employee's restriction or prohibition from use of Pueblo information systems and networks.</text>
              <text>Any employee determined by the Pueblo to have misused the technology, and supervisors who have failed to control the use of these resources appropriately, may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</text>
              <text>As used in this Policy, "systems" includes the use of all Pueblo owned or controlled resources to access both internal and external networks and systems. Systems may be any combination of computers, software, accessories, utilities and storage devices and media. Networks refer to any system for the transport of data, video, or voice.</text>

            <text>Directors are responsible for maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for their staff.

              <text>All employees, and everyone on Pueblo property, should be treated with courtesy and respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, "horseplay," or other conduct that may be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of the Pueblo without proper authorization.</text>
              <text>Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, a client, or a member of the public at any time, including off-duty periods, will not be tolerated. This prohibition includes all acts of harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual's sex, race, age, or any characteristic protected by federal law.</text>
              <text>All threats of, or actual, violence, both direct and indirect, must be reported as soon as possible to your immediate Director or any other member of management. This includes threats by employees, as well as threats by community members, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible.</text>
              <text>The Pueblo will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats and/or actual violence and suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the individual making a report will be protected as much as is practical. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, the Pueblo may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending investigation.</text>
              <text>Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of, or actual violence or other conduct that is in violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action, including termination of employment.</text>
              <text>The Pueblo encourages employees to bring their disputes or differences with other employees to the attention of their Directors or the Human Resources Department. If the matter cannot be resolved, then the Director and employee together should bring the matter to the attention of the Tribal Administrator. Thereafter, within the discretion of the Tribal Administrator, the matter may be brought to the attention of the Governor. The Pueblo is eager to assist in the resolution of employee disputes, and will not discipline employees for raising such concerns.</text>

          </text>
          <text>Statement of  Need</text>
          <text>The Pueblo has a strong commitment to the health, safety, and welfare of its employees, their families, and its constituents. Widely available statistics and  information establish that the incidence of drug and alcohol abuse is increasing and that the effect is devastating to lives, business, and the community at large. The Pueblo is concerned that due to the potential for</text>
          <text>abuse among some of our employees, the safety of our employees and the general public could be endangered. Our commitment to maintaining a safe and secure workplace requires a clear policy and supportive programs relating to the detection, treatment, and prevention of substance</text>
          <text>abuse by employees.</text>
          <text>Goal</text>
          <para>
            <num>1.</num>
            <text>It is the goal of the Pueblo to comply with federal regulations and guidelines established to reduce the use and abuse of controlled substances and drugs in the workplace.</text>

          <text>Scope</text>
          <text>This policy applies to all applicants seeking employment and employees of the Pueblo</text>
          <text>while on the job and to situations when an employee's off-the-job or off-premises conduct impairs work performance, or harms the reputation of the Pueblo. It is also intended to apply to employees of firms doing business with the Pueblo while on our premises or on tribal lands.</text>
          <text>Although the Pueblo has no intention of intruding into the private lives of its employees, we</text>
          <text>recognize that involvement with alcohol or other drugs off the job eventually takes its toll on job performance. Our concern is to assure those employees report to work in condition to perform  their duties safely and efficiently in the interest of their fellow workers and constituents as well</text>
          <text>as themselves.</text>

            <text>The Pueblo will not tolerate or condone substance abuse.   It is the policy of the Pueblo to maintain a workplace free from alcohol and other drug abuse and its effects.

          </text>
          <text>Self-Referral</text>
          <text>Employees with personal drug or controlled substance abuse problems should request assistance through their individual Programs, the Human Resources Department or the Pueblo's employee assistance program. Assistance will be provided on a confidential basis, and each employee will be referred to the appropriate treatment and counseling services. Employees who voluntarily request assistance in dealing with drug or controlled substance abuse problems may do so without jeopardizing their continued employment with the Pueblo subject to the Special Consideration  below.</text>
          <text>Pueblo Referral</text>
          <text>Employees who test positive for illegal drug  use or controlled substance abuse and who are referred, at the Pueblo's request, for counseling or treatment will be limited to one opportunity for counseling or treatment to cease the use of illegal drugs and alcohol. A second positive test following treatment for the use of illegal drugs will result in immediate termination.   Employees</text>
          <text>terminated for this reason will be ineligible for rehire.</text>
          <text>Special Consideration</text>
          <text>All Pueblo-referred, employee counseling and/or treatment, will require that the employee immediately cease any illegal drug and/or controlled substance abuse and the employee be subject to periodic unannounced testing for a 12 month period following enrollment in the program.</text>
          <text>Undergoing treatment or counseling for the first time will normally not jeopardize an employee's</text>
          <text>employment. However, the Pueblo is required in certain situations to report an employee's involvement with drug use or controlled substance to Government agencies (DOT) concerned with national security, health and safety-sensitive. In these situations, the Pueblo will be required to remove the employee from a position involving national security, health, safety-sensitive, or confidential matters. If other work cannot be found, the employee may be subject to termination.</text>
          <text>Alcohol Use or Possession on Pueblo Premises</text>
          <text>The use, possession, sale, or distribution of alcohol on Pueblo premises, or in Pueblo-supplied vehicles, whether during working hours or nonworking hours,is prohibited and constitutes a violation of policy.   Such action will be handled pursuant to the Pueblo's policy on work</text>

            <u>SUPERVISORY TRAINING</u>
            <strong>(step 3)</strong>
          </text>
          <text>Purpose</text>
          <text>Supervisors are the key to a successful substance abuse program and therefore should be</text>
          <text>trained on all aspects of substance abuse and its effects in the work place. They have a legitimate</text>
          <text>right to initiate corrective actions when a worker's performance begins to decline. If it appears that personal problems including substance abuse may be impacting on performance, the use of constructive confrontation is one of the most effective ways known to get an employee to seek help.</text>
          <text>Confronting a worker about a performance problem can be constructive when a caring but</text>
          <text>firm attitude on the part of the supervisor is coupled with a referral to an appropriate source from</text>
          <text>which the employee can receive help for any personal problem. However, the supervisor's responsibility for monitoring job performance does not extend to diagnosing and resolving the personal problem. As the people in direct contact with workers, supervisors can detect performance problems that may indicate substance abuse. But their responsibilities should be limited, and that should be clearly explained to them.</text>
          <text><u>EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM</u> (EAP) <strong>(step 4)</strong></text>
          <text>Employees who desire help with an alcohol or related problem may request assistance  through</text>
          <text>the Pueblo's Human Resources Department or Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Assistance</text>
          <text>will be provided on a confidential basis, and each employee will be referred to the appropriate treatment and counseling services. Employees who voluntarily request assistance may do so without jeopardizing their continued employment with the Pueblo. Employees may utilize the benefits programs that the Pueblo recently implemented or be afforded the use of any recognized agency to identify the source of  the problem and find practical solutions as quickly as possible.</text>
          <text>EAP services are available to the employee without charge, however, the cost of referrals to</text>
          <text>treatment or rehabilitation  is the responsibility of the employee if the cost is not completely</text>
          <text>covered by insurance. In support of our drug-free workplace, our insurance plans include some</text>
          <text>coverage for the treatment of addiction. An employee who tests positive on an alcohol and/or drug test may be referred to the EAP for assessment and rehabilitation recommendations. The</text>
          <text>employee's decision to participate in the recommended treatment, successful completion of the</text>
          <text>program and additional treatment recommendations will be communicated to the organization.</text>

Employees in safety-sensitive positions must be tested for controlled substances no later than 32 hours after the accident and no later than 8 hours after the accident for alcohol testing as mandated by DOT. DOT places the burden .of compliance with post-accident alcohol and drug testing regulations on the individual in safety-sensitive positions</text>

          <text>Collections</text>
          <text>Collections will be done at the Behavioral Health Program located in San Juan Pueblo (#505/852-2788). The Employee Assistance Coordinator (EAC) and or designated representative</text>
          <text>will conduct specimen collections and ensure chain of custody procedures in accordance with procedures established by the testing laboratory. The standard legal protocol checklist for SAFE drug screen collections will be utilized for both standard and split-sample collections. S.E.D. Labs provides a bonded courier service for collections pickup Monday through Friday to transfer the specimen from the collection point to and from the laboratory. They also provide all testing supplies (800999-LABS).</text>
          <text>Negative drug test results are available within 24 hours of the time the specimen arrives</text>
          <text>at the Laboratory in Albuquerque. Positive screening tests require confirmatory testing which require an additional 24-48 hours. These results are sent to the MRO. The MRO will contact the</text>
          <text>employee(s) who have positive drug testing results to determine if the result is due to prescription drugs. The MRO will then either call or FAX results to the Behavioral Health Program followed by written results sent by mail. Positive results will be reviewed by the EAC</text>
          <text>and forwarded to the Human Resources Director for consultation with the employees Program Director. A referral can then be made to the Pueblo's EAP (based on previous substance abuse history) or potential termination of employment.</text>

          </text>
          <text>The Pueblo will not permit or tolerate harassment of employees by other employees. This includes harassment because of race, sex, religious, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, disability or medical condition, age, or any other basis protected by federal law. Such conduct by an employee could result in corrective action up to, and including termination of employment.</text>
          <text>No harassment will be tolerated and sexual, racial, religious, ethnic, disability, sexual orientation and other form of legally impermissible harassment in any manner or form is expressly prohibited.  If an employee becomes aware of inappropriate harassment in the workplace whether directed at himself/herself or any other person, they have an obligation to bring it to the attention of their director, the Tribal Administrator, Human Resources Coordinator or any other Pueblo official with whom they are comfortable discussing the</text>
          <text>issue. The situation will then be investigated appropriately and privacy will be maintained</text>
          <text>to the extent feasible under the circumstances. Retaliation against any individual who complains about an incident of harassment or cooperates in any investigation of alleged harassment is strictly prohibited.</text>
          <text>
            <strong>704. Progressive Discipline</strong>
          </text>
          <text>The purpose of this policy is to state the Pueblo of San Ildefonso's position on administering equitable and consistent discipline for unsatisfactory conduct in the workplace.</text>
          <text>The Pueblo's own best interest lies in ensuring fair treatment of all employees and in making certain that disciplinary actions are prompt, uniform and impartial. The major purpose of any disciplinary action is to correct the problem, prevent recurrence, and prepare the employee for satisfactory service in the future.</text>
          <text>Although employment with the Pueblo is based on mutual consent and both the Employee and the Pueblo have the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, the Pueblo shall use progressive discipline for those activities or conduct that do not require immediate termination.</text>
          <text>Progressive disciplinary action should include these four steps:</text>

            <text><u>Suspension Without Pay</u> - A Director may suspend an employee without pay. A hearing shall be scheduled, with the Governor or his designee, for the third working day after the employee's formal notification of suspension. The Director, the Human Resources Coordinator, the employee, the Tribal Administrator, and the Governor should be present for the hearing. The employee shall not be suspended for more than (3) working days. No Department of the Tribe shall hire the suspended employee during the suspension period.

              <strong>705. Grievances and Appeals</strong>
            </text>
            <text>It is the policy of the Pueblo to ensure that all employees have access to a process for workplace grievances to be heard in a safe and fair manner.  A grievance, as established in this policy shall be defined as an employee's unresolved dissatisfaction with any aspect of the working conditions (except termination) or working relationships which is brought to the attention of a supervisor or Human Resources Department (HR).  An employee filing a grievance shall be free from restraint, coercion, discrimination, or reprisal.  The Pueblo recognizes the importance of open communication in resolving disputes.  All complaints shall receive full and fair consideration.  The grievance process shall be kept confidential and all communications, documents, and records relating to a grievance shall be kept in a separate file and maintained by the Human Resources Department.</text>
            <text>A probationary employee shall not be permitted to file a grievance.  A termination of an employee shall not be subject to the grievance process.  An employee filing a grievance shall be responsible to comply with the requirements of this policy including any time deadlines.</text>

              <text>The following grievance procedures shall apply to all grievances within the executive administration under the authority of the Governor:</text>
              <text><strong><u>Step 1 (Informal):</u></strong> An aggrieved employee is encouraged to attempt to resolve the dispute or problem in an informal, non-confrontational manner by making an appointment with their immediate Supervisor to discuss the matter. The Supervisor shall promptly inform his/her supervisor and the HR in writing that an aggrieved employee has requested a meeting to discuss an issue.  The aggrieved employee and Supervisor shall promptly meet to discuss and attempt to resolve the matter.  If the matter cannot be resolved informally, or if the employee does not believe that a discussion with their Supervisor is appropriate, then an aggrieved employee shall be required to go through the following steps to file a formal grievance or to appeal a grievance decision:</text>
              <text><strong><u>Step 2 (Formal):</u></strong> An aggrieved employee shall file a written grievance with the next supervisor in the chain of command that is not a party to the grievance within thirty (14) calendar days of the occurrence of the event or incident with a copy to the HR.    That supervisor shall schedule a meeting with the employee within five (5) calendar days following the submission of the grievance with a copy to HR. That supervisor shall make a decision regarding the grievance, in writing, within three (3) calendar days after the meeting and shall notify the aggrieved employee of the decision in person and by mail.  That supervisor shall provide a copy of the decision to the Human Resources Department.  If that supervisor fails to act in a timely manner, then the employee may proceed to Step 3.</text>
              <text><strong><u>Step 3 (Appeal to Ad Hoc Committee):</u></strong> If the employee is not satisfied with the decision of the supervisor who made the decision in Step 2 the employee may file an appeal of the decision with the HR. Filing must take place within five (5) calendar days after supervisor's decision or, in case of no action, within five (5) calendar days after the final day of the supervisor's decision-making time limit.</text>
              <text>The HR Director shall schedule a meeting with the aggrieved employee and the Supervisor within five (5) calendar days of the appeal. The aggrieved employee may present witnesses and other evidence in a reasonable manner.</text>
              <text>The HR shall randomly select 1 supervisor from the pool of supervisors and 1 randomly selected non-supervisor and 1 randomly selected employee from the entire pool of employees, and these 3 shall serve on an Ad Hoc Committee who shall hear the appeal.</text>
              <text>The Ad Hoc committee shall make a decision regarding the grievance, in writing, within three (3) calendar days after the meeting and shall notify the aggrieved employee of the decision in person and by mail.  The Ad Hoc committee shall provide a copy of the decision to the Human Resources Department.  The decision of the Ad Hoc Committee shall be final.</text>

              <text>A grievance shall not exist until such time that an employee makes known to their supervisor or the HR that employment dissatisfaction exists.  A formal grievance shall be in writing and shall be specific and supported by factual evidence. The employee filing a grievance shall be required to be present at each proceeding of their case.  Failure to follow the steps above, will result in a dismissal of the grievance.</text>

              <text>The Governor shall have the authority to intervene and address an employee grievance against any employee of the executive branch of government under the authority of the Governor notwithstanding the requirements of this policy.  Depending on the nature of the grievance, the Governor shall have the sole discretion to address a grievance in a manner other than the process established in this policy and may reasonably modify the deadlines in this policy due to unforeseen or extraordinary circumstances.  The Governor may not involve himself in a grievance if any party to the grievance is an immediate family member or  closer relative.</text>
