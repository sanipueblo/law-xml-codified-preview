            <text>INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES</text>
            <text>In order to meet its needs, the investment strategy of the Pueblo is to emphasize total return; that is, the aggregate return from capital appreciation and dividend and interest income.</text>
            <text>SPECIFIC INVESTMENT GOALS</text>
            <text>Over the investment horizon established in this Statement, it is the goal of the aggregate Investment Account(s) assets to exceed an absolute annualized, return of 10% over a market cycle of 10 years unless the Tribe hires an additional investment manager(s) with a different investment style of investments.</text>
            <text>The investment goal above is the objective of the aggregate Investment Account(s), and is not meant to be imposed on each investment account (if more than one account is used).  The goal of the investment manager, over the investment horizon, shall be to:</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>1.</num>
            <text>Meet or exceed the market index, or blended market index, selected and agreed upon by the Investment Committee that most closely corresponds to the style of the investment manager.</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>2.</num>
            <text>Display an overall level of risk in the portfolio which is consistent with the risk associated with the benchmark specified above.  Risk will be measured by the standard deviation of quarterly returns.</text>
            <text>Specific investment goals and constraints for each investment manager, if any, shall be incorporated as part of this Statement of Investment Policy.  The manager shall receive a written statement outlining his/her specific goals as they differ from those objectives of the entire Investment Account.</text>
            <text>DEFINITION OF RISK</text>
            <text>The Council realizes that there are many ways to define risk.  The Council believes that any person or organization involved in the process of managing the Pueblo's assets understands how the Pueblo defines risk so that the assets are managed in a manner consistent with the Investment Account(s)'s objectives and investment strategy as defined in this statement of investment policy.  The Council defines risk as:</text>
            <text>The probability of not meeting the Investment Account(s)'s objectives.</text>
            <text>LIQUIDITY</text>
            <text>To minimize the possibility of a loss caused by the need to liquidate securities<em>, </em>the Governor will periodically provide investment managers with an estimate of expected net cash flow.  The Governor will notify the investment manager in a timely manner, to allow sufficient time for the money manager to build up necessary liquid reserves.  The Governor will inform the Council, through the Lt. Governor, of the cash flow need estimate provided to the Investment Manager(s).</text>
            <text>To maintain the ability to deal with unplanned cash requirements that might arise, the Council prefers that a minimum of 1% of Investment Account(s) assets shall be maintained in cash of cash equivalents, including money market funds or short-term U.S. Treasury bills.</text>
            <text>MARKETABILITY OF ASSETS</text>
            <text>The Council requires that all Investment Account(s) assets be invested in liquid securities, defined as securities that can be transacted quickly and efficiently for the Investment Account(s), with minimal impact on market price.</text>

          <text>Derivative Investments</text>
          <text>Derivative securities are defined as synthetic securities whose price and cash flow characteristics are based on the cash flows and price movements of other underlying securities.  Most derivative securities are derived from equity of fixed income securities and are packaged in the form of options, futures, CMOS (PAC bonds, IO's, PO's, residual bonds, etc.), and interest rate swaps, among others.</text>
          <text>The Council feels that many derivative securities are relatively new and therefore have not been observed over multiple economic cycles.  Due to this uncertainty, investment in derivative securities shall not be permitted.</text>
          <text>Stock Exchanges</text>
          <text>To ensure marketability and liquidity, investment advisors will execute equity transactions through the following exchanges: New York Stock Exchange; American Stock Exchange; NASDAQ over-the-counter market; and the major Canadian Exchanges.</text>

            <text>The Council may employ investment managers whose investment disciplines require investment outside the established asset allocation guidelines.  However, taken as a component of the aggregate Investment Account(s), such disciplines must fit within the overall asset allocation guidelines established in this Policy.  Such investment managers will receive written direction from the Investment Committee regarding specific objectives and guidelines.</text>

            <text>including but not limited to market price fluctuations, the Investment Committee will instruct the Investment Manager(s) to bring the portfolio(s) into compliance with these guidelines as promptly and prudently as possible.  In addition, in the event that any individual Investment Manager's portfolio is in violation with its specific guidelines, for reasons including but not limited to market price fluctuations, the Council expects that the Investment Manager will bring the portfolio into compliance with these guidelines as promptly and prudently as possible without instruction from the Governor or Council.</text>
            <text>Diversification for Investment Managers</text>
            <text>It is not necessary or desirable that securities held in the Investment Account(s) represent a cross section of the economy.  However, in order to achieve a prudent level of portfolio diversification for the Investment Account(s), the following allocation limitations will be imposed:</text>
            <text><strong>Equity:</strong>  	Sector of Industry Group allocations is limited to a <strong>current market value</strong> of 35% of the Account(s).  The <strong>current market value </strong>of any one equity security is limited to 15% of any single segregated manager's portfolio.  These allocation limitations pertain to each separately managed portfolio.</text>
            <text>Guidelines for Cash Equivalents</text>
            <text>Money Market Funds selected shall contain securities whose credit rating at the absolute minimum would be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor's, and/or Moody's.</text>
            <text>SELECTION OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS</text>
            <text>The recommendation of Investment Manager(s) by the Governor and approval by the Council must be based on prudent due diligence procedures.  A qualifying investment manager must be a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, or a bank or insurance company.  The Council requires that each investment manager provide, in writing, acknowledgement of fiduciary responsibility to the Pueblo.</text>
            <text>INVESTMENT MANAGER PERFORMANCE REVIEW AND EVALUATION</text>
            <text>Performance reports generated by the Manager(s) shall be compiled at least quarterly and communicated to the Governor, and Council through the Lt. Governor, for review.  The investment performance of the total Account(s), as well as each individual manager, will be measured against commonly accepted performance benchmarks.  Consideration shall be given to the extent to which the investment results are consistent with the investment objectives, goals and guidelines as set forth in this Statement.  The Governor and Council intend to evaluate the portfolio(s) over a 3 year period, but reserve the right to terminate a manager for any reason including the following:</text>

            <text>Adherence to Investment Discipline – Investment managers will be expected to adhere to the investment management styles for which they were hired.  Managers will be evaluated regularly for adherence to investment discipline.</text>
            <text>INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES</text>
            <text>In order to meet its needs, the investment strategy of the Pueblo is to emphasize total return; that is, the aggregate return from capital appreciation and dividend and interest income.</text>
            <text>SPECIFIC INVESTMENT GOALS</text>
            <text>Over the investment horizon established in this Statement, it is the goal of the aggregate Investment Account(s) assets to exceed an absolute annualized, return of 5%, over a market cycle of 5 years unless the Tribe hires an additional investment manager(s) with a different investment style of investments.</text>
            <text>The investment goal above is the objective of the aggregate Investment Account(s), and is not meant to be imposed on each investment account (if more than one account is used).  The goal of the investment manager, over the investment horizon, shall be to:</text>
          </para>
          <para>
            <num>1.</num>
            <text>Meet or exceed the market index, or blended market index, selected and agreed upon by the Investment Committee that most closely corresponds to the style of the investment manager.</text>

          <para>
            <num>2.</num>
            <text>Display an overall level of risk in the portfolio which is consistent with the risk associated with the benchmark specified above.  Risk will be measured by the standard deviation of quarterly returns.</text>
            <text>Specific investment goals and constraints for each investment manager, if any, shall be incorporated as part of this Statement of Investment Policy.  The manager shall receive a written statement outlining his/her specific goals as they differ from those objectives of the entire Investment Account.</text>
            <text>DEFINITION OF RISK</text>
            <text>The Council realizes that there are many ways to define risk.  The Council believes that any person or organization involved in the process of managing the Pueblo's assets understands how the Pueblo defines risk so that the assets are managed in a manner consistent with the Investment Account(s)'s objectives and investment strategy as defined in this statement of investment policy.  The Council defines risk as:</text>
            <text>The probability of not meeting the Investment Account(s)'s objectives.</text>
            <text>LIQUIDITY</text>
            <text>To minimize the possibility of a loss caused by the need to liquidate securities<em>, </em>the Governor will periodically provide investment managers with an estimate of expected net cash flow.  The Governor will notify the investment manager in a timely manner, to allow sufficient time for the money manager to build up necessary liquid reserves.    The Governor will inform the Council through the Lt. Governor, of the cash flow need estimate provided to the Investment Manager(s).</text>
            <text>To maintain the ability to deal with unplanned cash requirements that might arise, the Council prefers that a minimum of 1% of Investment Account(s) assets shall be maintained in cash of cash equivalents, including money market funds or short-term U.S. Treasury bills.</text>
            <text>MARKETABILITY OF ASSETS</text>
            <text>The Council requires that all  Investment Account(s) assets be invested in liquid securities, defined as securities that can be transacted quickly and efficiently for the Investment Account(s), with minimal impact on market price.</text>

          <text>Derivative Investments</text>
          <text>Derivative securities are defined as synthetic securities whose price and cash flow characteristics are based on the cash flows and price movements of other underlying securities.  Most derivative securities are derived from equity of fixed income securities and are packaged in the form of options, futures, CMOS (PAC bonds, IO's, PO's, residual bonds, etc.), and interest rate swaps, among others.</text>
          <text>The Council feels that many derivative securities are relatively new and therefore have not been observed over multiple economic cycles.  Due to this uncertainty, investment in derivative securities shall not be permitted.</text>
          <text>Stock Exchanges</text>
          <text>To ensure marketability and liquidity, investment advisors will execute equity transactions through the following exchanges: New York Stock Exchange; American Stock Exchange; NASDAQ over-the-counter market; and the major Canadian Exchanges.</text>

            <text>The Council may employ investment managers whose investment disciplines require investment outside the established asset allocation guidelines.

            <text>In the event that the above aggregate asset allocation guidelines are violated, for reasons</text>
            <text>including but not limited to market price fluctuations, the Investment Committee will instruct the Investment Manager(s) to bring the portfolio(s) into compliance with these guidelines as promptly and prudently as possible.  In addition, in the event that any individual Investment Manager's portfolio is in violation with its specific guidelines, for reasons including but not limited to market price fluctuations, the Council expects that the Investment Manager will bring the portfolio into compliance with these guidelines as promptly and prudently as possible without instruction from the Governor or Council.</text>
            <text>Diversification for Investment Managers</text>
            <text>It is not necessary or desirable that securities held in the Investment Account(s) represent a cross section of the economy.  However, in order to achieve a prudent level of portfolio diversification for the Investment Account(s), the following allocation limitations will be imposed:</text>
            <text><strong>Equity:</strong> 	Sector of Industry Group allocations is limited to a <strong>current market value</strong> of 35% of the Account(s).  The <strong>current market value </strong>of any one equity security is limited to 15% of any single segregated manager's portfolio.  These allocation limitations pertain to each separately managed portfolio.</text>
            <text>Guidelines for Cash Equivalents</text>
            <text>Money Market Funds selected shall contain securities whose credit rating at the absolute minimum would be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor's, and/or Moody's.</text>
            <text>SELECTION OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS</text>
            <text>The recommendation of Investment Manager(s) by the Governor and approval by the Council must be based on prudent due diligence procedures.  A qualifying investment manager must be a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, or a bank or insurance company.  The Council requires that each investment manager provide, in writing, acknowledgement of fiduciary responsibility to the Pueblo.</text>
            <text>INVESTMENT MANAGER PERFORMANCE REVIEW AND EVALUATION</text>
            <text>Performance reports generated by the Manager(s) shall be compiled at least quarterly and communicated to the Governor, and Council through the Lt. Governor, for review.  The investment performance of the total Account(s), as well as each individual manager, will be measured against commonly accepted performance benchmarks.  Consideration shall be given to the extent to which the investment results are consistent with the investment objectives, goals and guidelines as set forth in this Statement.  The Governor and Council intend to evaluate the portfolio(s) over a 3 year period, but reserve the right to terminate a manager for any reason including the following:</text>
